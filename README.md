#  Magic 8 Ball

This app is built in Swift and it's part of a Udemy Course to become an iOS Developer.

## The Goal

The objective of this repo is to apply the skills I learned with the Dicee tutorial app and get a this new app with functionality all done by myself. You can ask the app to make all your hard decisions! With this app in your pocket, you’ll always have an answer to life’s many conundrums!
